# SnapCMS
A Smart Content Management System for blogs.

## Goals
The goals of this SnapCMS is to be snappy with great user experience for modern content creators, developers, and readers.

Goals in brief:
- snappy & speed performance
- distraction-free UI with simple but advanced when you need it
- responsive/works perfectly on all screen sizes
- cross platform with top notch performance (clients)

## Design Pattern & Concept of CMS
- `index.php` : gallery view of articles
- `login.php` : login session
- `logout.php` : destroy session
- `post.php` : use Markdown to edit content
- `contact/index.php` : contact form
- `privacy.php` : privacy policy
- `about.php` : about website
- `/category/cat1` : category URLs
- `/admin/` : add or edit or publish content
- `/howto/` : howto guides n tutorials for the CMS
- `/admin/` contains `edit.php`, `edit-comments.php`, `profile.php`, `tools.php`.

## Scheduling Work (Plan)
